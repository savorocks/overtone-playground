# overtone-playground

Overtone Playground is a library that opens the door for learning and exploring music with [Clojure](https://clojure.org/) and [Overtone](https://github.com/overtone/overtone)

The development of the library is sponsored by [Clojurists Together](https://www.clojuriststogether.org/) in Q1 2022.

## Usage

Clone this project and start a REPL. Then change the namespace to *overtone-playground.core* and start experimenting. If you want to learn how, read on.

The guide that is complementary to this project is written in form of series of blog posts on my website, [savo.rocks](https://savo.rocks).
This approach allows for regular feedback from the readers and users interested in diving into Overtone, which helps me to better understand
the struggles people face when trying to learn how to learn live coding and programming.

The particular articles that are part of this series are in the [Clojurists Together 2022 Q1](https://savo.rocks/categories/clojurists-together-2022-q1/) category, and new ones are frequently published.

From those posts and feedback from the users I will combine the two and make comprehensive guide in the style of [Sonic-Pi Tutorial](https://sonic-pi.net/tutorial.html).
